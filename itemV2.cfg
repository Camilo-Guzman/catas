title = "Cata 2 & 3 in Adventure Maps";
description = "Adds Cataclysm 2 and Cataclysm 3 to Adventure Maps. 
Has proper implementation, so you can select them from the Difficulty Screen and so Terror Events are balanced to their Cataclysm (1) equivalent.

An option to use 900 Hero Power, Like in Weaves (will be removed if sanctioned).
Options to increase the skill cieling such as moddifying the Bonus Damage that the stagger system gives you and the stagger resistance of enemies.

I believe I fixed all potential crashes, but if it does send the crash log to me on the [url=https://discord.gg/3RRVRDR]Modders Discord[/url].";
